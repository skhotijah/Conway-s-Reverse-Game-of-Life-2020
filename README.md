This repositories contains my solution of the Conway's Reverse Game of Life 2020  Competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/conways-reverse-game-of-life-2020

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. The game consists of a board of cells that are either on or off. One creates an initial configuration of these on/off states and observes how it evolves. There are four simple rules to determine the next state of the game board, given the current state:

- Overpopulation: if a living cell is surrounded by more than three living cells, it dies.
- Stasis: if a living cell is surrounded by two or three living cells, it survives.
- Underpopulation: if a living cell is surrounded by fewer than two living cells, it dies.
- Reproduction: if a dead cell is surrounded by exactly three cells, it becomes a live cell.
